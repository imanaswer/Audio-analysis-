# Audio-analysis-
we are creating a Streamlit web application for audio feature analysis. The application allows users to upload video files, converts them to audio, and analyzes various audio features, including total frequency, pitch, tone, and duration.
Streamlit Interface:

The application is built using the Streamlit framework, providing an interactive and user-friendly web interface.
File Upload:

Users can upload video files (in formats like mp4 or mov) through the web interface.
Video to Audio Conversion:

The uploaded video files are converted to audio using the Pydub library's AudioSegment class.
Audio Feature Analysis:

The calculate_audio_features function utilizes the librosa library to extract various audio features such as total frequency, pitch, tone, and duration.
Due to memory issues with the librosa.yin function, you might need to explore alternative pitch detection methods or optimize the code for memory efficiency.
Data Visualization:

The calculated audio features are displayed in a tabular format using Streamlit's st.dataframe.
Additionally, an audio heatmap is generated using Plotly Express to visualize the frequency content of the audio.
Memory Profiling (Optional):

The script includes suggestions for using the memory_profiler tool to identify and address potential memory issues.
User Interaction:

Users can interact with the web application by selecting modalities, specifying the number of videos to upload, and uploading the videos.
Web Application Deployment (Not Included):

The provided script is designed to be run locally. If you wish to deploy the application for public access, additional steps for deployment and hosting would be needed.
